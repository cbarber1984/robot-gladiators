# ROBOT GLADIATORS!
_Description_
A robbot battle game using JavaScript
The game is available [HERE](https://cbarber1984.github.io/robot-gladiators/)

**NOTE: This game is still under active development**

## Objective
- Build an interactive web app using JavaScript
- Use JavaScript conditional statements
- Utilize various methods of acquiring user input


## What I Learned
- The importance of considering edge cases when desigining user interactions
- Commenting intendended outcomes sequentially helps when writing code. It reminds me of the construction phrase "measure twice, cut once."
- Using breaks in JavaScript to exit loops
- Using switch statements to assist with control flow
- Using Math.random and Math.floor methods to generate random numbers from a specific range
- Creating methods for objects to keep like data coupled together as well as to make code more readable
- Using the Web Storage API to store information in the browser
